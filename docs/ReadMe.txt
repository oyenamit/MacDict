         MacDict Firefox Extension: Launch Mac OS X built-in Dictionary from Firefox
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The MacDict Firefox extension allows a user to select some text in the Firefox browser and
look it up in the Mac OS X built-in dictionary. This extension is designed to work only on
Mac OS X.


Using the extension:
---------------------
1.  Open any website in Firefox browser.
2.  Select some text in the browser.
3.  Right-click (or control-click) on the selected text.
4.  From the popup menu that appears, select "Lookup in Dictionary" option.
5.  The built-in dictionary will open and the selected text will be searched in it.



PS: The reason for developing this extension was that the Safari browser provides a similar
feature and I was missing it while using Firefox.
