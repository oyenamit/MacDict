#MacDict Firefox Extension
The MacDict Firefox extension allows a user to select some text in the Firefox browser and look it up in the Mac OS X built-in Dictionary application. This extension is designed to work only on Mac OS X.


##Installation
You can install the extension by building it from source or by downloading it from the [Mozilla Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/macdict/) site.

2.  Select some text in the browser.

***
PS: The reason for developing this extension was that the Safari browser provides a similar feature and I was missing it while using Firefox.
